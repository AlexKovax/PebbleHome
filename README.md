PebbleHome
==========

PebbleHome is my first Pebble app using Pebble.js

I have built a remotely controlled heating system for my flat (details here -> http://kovaxlabs.com/post/72797660039/how-i-built-a-remote-controlled-heating-system) and the Pebble app is a new component for it. Basically it sends Ajax request to the server that will then send Z-Wave commands to turn on and off the heater.

There's a pretty good chance this won't be of any use for you but that might help as a very basic example of Pebble app.

As usual, let me know if I can help :)
